## About

Lock is a CLI tool to assist with Morpheus plugin development and download of prebuilt plugin JAR files.

Users can inspect and clone Morpheus plugin starter templates, tagged by Morpheus tested version or semantic version.
Users can also inspect and download prebuilt JAR plugins at a specific version and compatibility.

Lock currently uses [share.morpheusdata.com](https://share.morpheusdata.com) for information about prebuilt plugins and a [git repository here](https://github.com/spoonboy-io/lock-plugin-metadata)
to maintain starter template project information.
